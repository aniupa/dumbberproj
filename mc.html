  Irrigation is the process of applying water to the crops artificially to fulfil their water requirements. Nutrients may also be provided to the crops through irrigation. The various sources of water for irrigation are wells, ponds, lakes, canals, tube-wells and even dams. Irrigation offers moisture required for growth and development, germination and other related functions.
  
  The frequency, rate, amount and time of irrigation are different for different crops and also vary according to the types of soil and seasons. For example, summer crops require a higher amount of water as compared to winter crops.
  
  Let us have a look at different types of irrigation and the methods used for irrigation.
